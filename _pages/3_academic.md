### <a name="research"></a> Research

I'm interested in designing neural network architectures for newer tasks and unseen datasets, exploiting various symmetries and invarianced that exist in them. I am currently working on trying to model dynamic-FBA using neural ODE family of models. 

More specifically I'm interested in:

* Geometric-DL
* Precision Medicine
* Neural ODEs/PDEs
* Physics informed DL
* Program Synthesis
* And more things

I am co-advised by [Xiao Zhang](https://xiao-zhang.net/) and [Pietro Lio](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/).
