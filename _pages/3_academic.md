### <a name="research"></a> Research

I am broadly interested in [TODO]
More specifically I'm interested in:

* Geometric-DL
* TODO

I am co-advised by [Xiao Zhang](https://xiao-zhang.net/) and [Pietro Lio](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/).

**Update [TODO]:**

* Recently completed a project that is the first chapter of my dissertation.
  + *Spatially Selected and Dependent Random Effects for Small Area Estimation with Application to Rent Burden*
  + [Access the ArXiv preprint here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12463).
* Excited to be presenting this paper at [JSM in Portland](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2024/).
  + Session Name: *Innovative Modeling Approaches for Small Area Estimation in the Presence of Complex Dependence Structures*
  + August 4th, 2024 at 4:00pm-5:50pm.
